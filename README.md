The repo includes two articles:
1. [A derivation of back propagation through time for vanilla recurrent neural network](bptt/bptt.pdf), which covers
   1. scalar form
   2. vector form for a single data point
   3. vector form for multiple data points 
2. [A brief tutorial on vector derivative](vector_derivative/vectorDerivative.pdf), which covers
   1. jacobian and concept
   2. case of single data point where the input is a column vector
   3. case of single data point where the input is a row vector
   4. case of multiple data points 
   5. summary of computation needed for vector derivative

To do:
- finish the Y=XW batch form for vector derivative article
- code
- derivation for LSTM
