[Derivation](bptt/bptt.pdf) of back propagation through time for vanilla recurrent neural network, which includes
1. scalar form
2. vector form for a single data point
3. vector form for multiple data points 

[A brief tutorial on vector derivative](vector_derivative/vectorDerivative.pdf) 

To do:
- a summary of tools to use for deriving vector form back progapation (ongoing)
- code
- derivation for LSTM
